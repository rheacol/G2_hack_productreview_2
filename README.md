# Survey Responses Feature Extraction

This project involves fetching survey responses from an API, extracting features, drawbacks, recommendations, and benefits from the responses, and saving the extracted data in an Excel sheet for analysis.

## Overview

The project consists of two main Python files:

- `xlsheet_generate.py`: This script fetches survey responses from an API using an API token, saves them in an Excel file, and prepares them for feature extraction.
- `feature_extraction.py`: This script reads the survey responses from the Excel file, preprocesses the text, and extracts features, drawbacks, recommendations, and benefits. The extracted data is then saved in an updated Excel file.

## Files

- `xlsheet_generate.py`: Python script to fetch and save survey responses.
- `feature_extraction.py`: Python script to extract features, drawbacks, recommendations, and benefits from survey responses.
- `survey_responses.xlsx`: Initial Excel file containing survey responses.
- `updated_excel_with_features.xlsx`: Updated Excel file with extracted features, drawbacks, recommendations, and benefits.

## Detailed Functionality

### `xlsheet_generate.py`

- Fetches survey responses from an API using an API token for authorization.
- Makes a GET request to the API endpoint (`https://data.g2.com/api/v1/survey-responses`).
- Saves the survey responses to an Excel file named `survey_responses.xlsx`.
- Handles errors during the API request and prints error messages if necessary.

### `feature_extraction.py`

- Reads the survey responses from the Excel file generated by `xlsheet_generate.py`.
- Preprocesses the text data by converting it to lowercase and extracting words.
- Identifies specific features, drawbacks, recommendations, and benefits mentioned in the survey responses based on keyword patterns.
- Adds the extracted information as columns to the DataFrame.
- Saves the updated DataFrame to a new Excel file named `updated_excel_with_features.xlsx`.
- Iterates through each row of the DataFrame to print a summary of features, drawbacks, recommendations, and benefits based on certain criteria (based on if its a verified user,an organic review or a business partner).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`requests`, `pandas`, `re`).
3. Run `xlsheet_generate.py` to fetch and save survey responses.
4. Run `feature_extraction.py` to extract features, drawbacks, recommendations, and benefits.
5. View the extracted data in `updated_excel_with_features.xlsx`.
